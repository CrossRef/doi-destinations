# DOI Destinations

Tool to resolve a sample of DOIs to find which domains are used by Crossref members. Runs at [http://destinations.labs.crossref.org](destinations.labs.crossref.org). 

# Provides:

 - list of domain names that DOIs point to
 - list of domain names including subdomain, that DOIs point to
 - list of member prefixes
 - experimental guess-the-DOI for a given URL.

# Domain names

A selection of DOIs is resolved. The link URL, as well as the ultimate link URL in the case of multiple redirects, is recorded. DOIs are visited in a way that gives the most even distribution per DOI prefix.

# Guess-the-DOI

Guess-the-DOI returns the DOI for a given input, if it can find it. Experimental, put together for Twitter trial. Works for the following inputs:
 
## Variously expressed DOIs

 - `10.5555/123456789` - a DOI expressed outside a URL. [demo](http://destinations.labs.crossref.org/guess-doi?q=10.5555/123456789).
 - `doi: 10.5555/12345678` - a DOI expressed with a `doi:` prefix, flexibly. [demo](http://destinations.labs.crossref.org/guess-doi?q=doi: 10.5555/12345678).
 - `doi.org/10.5555/12345678` - a DOI expressed as a web address without full scheme. [demo](http://destinations.labs.crossref.org/guess-doi?q=doi.org/10.5555/12345678).
 - `http://doi.org/10.5555/12356789` - a DOI expressed as a full URL. [demo](http://destinations.labs.crossref.org/guess-doi?q=http://doi.org/10.5555/12356789).

## URLs of landing pages where the DOI can be figured out from the URL
 
 - `http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144297` - a landing page URL where the DOI is embedded in the URL as a GET query parameter. [demo](http://destinations.labs.crossref.org/guess-doi?q=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144297).

There will no doubt be a few other methods for figuring out the DOI from the URL in future.

## URLs of landing pages where the content of the page must be consulted

 - `http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aan/2015/708915/` - a landing page where the DOI is mentioned in the page. [demo](http://destinations.labs.crossref.org/guess-doi?q=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/aan/2015/708915/).

1. The textual and link content of the page are consulted and all DOIs are extracted.
2. The first DOI on the page is checked to see if it resolves back to the same URL.
3. After that, every other DOI is checked. If there are several matches (i.e. several DOIs resolve to the same URL) then the shortest DOI is chosen. This can happen with component DOIs, which in the case of e.g. PLOS, are extended versions of the base DOI.

Every DOI is checked against the API to ensure it exists.



# Installation

- Create a mysql database with schema in `etc/schema.sql`.
- Create `config.edn` with `:database-name`, `:database-username`, `:database-host`.

# To run

Some tasks can be run on the command line but the main mode of operation is as a server.

    lein run server

To update the list of DOI and member IDs per publisher:

  lein run update

To try and resolve the DOIs and extract domains. This will run until all DOIs are resolved (i.e. pretty much indefinitely).

  lein run resolve-all

## Ignored domains

Some domains are just too broad (like Google Pages). Maintain a list of these, in MySQL LIKE format in `resources/ignore.txt`. To update the database after a scan, or after updating the file:

    lein run mark-ignored
